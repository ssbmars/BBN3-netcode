# Experimental BBN3 Netplay

For anyone stumbling in on this, please be patient. This is not in a playable state yet. We do have playtesters already.


The main netplay script is "\BizHawk-2.5.2\bbn3_netplay.lua"

There are two batch files for launching the netplay script. "Launch Netplay.bat" in the root directory will load one instance.
There is also a "load tango double.bat" file in the BizHawk folder which will launch two local instances, good for testing stuff on local host.


# Misc

According to Bizhawk's documentation, the scripting feature is only compatible with 64bit Windows systems.  
There is nothing we can do about this. The Bizhawk developers simply haven't brought the scripting capabilities to Linux.  
There are future netplay solutions in the works that will have improved platform accessibility, but they will take longer to deliver on.
