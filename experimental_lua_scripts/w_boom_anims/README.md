# About
These contents adds boomsheetslua support via the lua module `boom`. 
Replacing the netplay script with the one in this folder adds an animated
sprite in the versus main loop as a proof-of-concept

Boomsheets is an animation tool that exports easy-to-parse animations.
The module returns an animation object that is easy to use in lua.
See the examples and readme for boomsheetlua for more info.

# How To
Place the contents of this folder into the same directory as the `load double netplay.bat` program.
This will overwrite `bbn3_netplay.lua` so make sure the original netplay script is backed up!
