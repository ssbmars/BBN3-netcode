Word Buster is a filter for Garry's Mod, it censors "bad words" with the character of your choice.
It uses the [**List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words**][1] *([License][2])* which contains more than 350 english words and then converts them into patterns so that it can catch most variants of the banned words.
